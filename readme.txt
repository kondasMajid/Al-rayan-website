You can start using these web pages right away.

All you have to do is replace my words with your own words.

To work on the pages you will need to open them in notepad (or another text editor). Be careful not to accidently erase any of the code. You might want to make back-up copies of the pages and also of your changes.

If you do accidently erase anything, you can always download the pages again. They are located at http://nicholasacademy.com/websiteforkids.html

Double click on the pages to open them in your browser.

All the pages need to be in the same folder for them to work properly.

Once you get familiar with some of the code, you can change colors, font types and sizes, add pictures, add more HTML tables, add your own styles. There is really no limit to the changes that can be made. 

Have fun!
